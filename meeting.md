Wang: Bugs in Democracy

Feedback problem: incumbent problem undermines democracy

New Gilded age
* Racial divisions
* Tech disruption
* Increasing inequality
* Deep partisanship
* PLUS Deep issue divisions

Polarization is increasing (and seems asymmetric)

Constitutional hardball (Mark Tushnet)

The effectiveness of gerrymandering (vote-result relationship changes sharply after 2010)

Communities of interest seems like a horrendous can of worms (commissions should try to let some communities get representatives)
* Q: How is this not a disaster?
* A: Cracking vs. packing; it sounds like a mess
	* Bad guys crack small groups, pack bigger ones.

Plotkin 

Information Gerrymandering and Undemocratic Decisions

Echo chambers and social media

Social media has much less regulation than broadband media
* Some of the agents in your echo chamber are bots

People are getting polarized, and not that worried about it
* but they say that they want politicians to compromise
* Q: Say that but do they mean it?

How do humans make collective decisions on social networks
… in the presence of conflicting incentives?

Game
* Payoff for consensus (greater if your team wins)
* Q: What about not bothering?
* Q: should you be more flexible about forms for p?
	* Asked: they couldn't get more info...
	* This part is not a Nash equilibrium

Results
* People switch about half the time when they're losing
* Weak explanations about the zealotry

Scenarios
* Random, extremes (you see only one team or the other)

Biased outcomes
* Unequal membership, unequal influence (boring)
* Unequal incentives (boring)
* Information gerrymandering (asymmetric assortment)

C: Get clear about cracking vs. packing

Simulations of a giant network

Data from real networks!
* US House of Representatives
* Political retweets and mentions

Lots of influence assortment, and lots of influence gaps
* French UC is a major outlier (also Czech to some extent)

US House
* When Gingrich took over the house, Dems failed to assort with Reps
* Consistent with other findings

Open questions
* party-level prisoner's dilemma
	* how to avoid deadlock
* abstention
* network evolution, zealotry

Tuesday
=======

Levin session

Modeling opinion changes

Levin: When and why does your opinion on one issue predict your opinion on other issues?

Kinzig: What do we mean by polarization and partisanship?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Graham session

Centeno: Polarization is less organization-based than partisanship, more of a complex-system phenomenon. Cause and effect are deeply entwined in polarization. Identity vectors: ethnicity, consumption, politics, sports-support. Human group-identity instinct. Also "individualization". That fits in somewhere. Co-operation is the flip side; promoted by self-other split.

Non-partisan examples
* Brexit
* pre-civil rights US and racial issues (Wang)

Yif: muddies the water to some extent. 

Forrest: partisanship is team identity?
* Centeno, no. Now these things are a loop, which makes it much clearer what he means, but less clear how we distinguish.

Keena: Polarization moderates dropping out (or keeping quiet?). Partisanship: commitment to the party

Manfred: To what extent is resource scarcity required?
* Dushoff: none. There will always be inequality
* Centeno: said exactly what I was thinking

Q: Who was excluded when FDR set up Social Security?

Centeno: Polarization is increasing everywhere except East Asia, apparently. 
* What are the structural differences there?
* To what extent is status anxiety a driver?
* Liberalism assumes non-zero-sum games. The more global you are, the more this seems to break down
* We are losing epistemological hegemony (i.e, consensus on facts)
* Rules are seen as a source of power, calls all rules into question
* Identities (e.g., true AMerican) called into question
* de-humanization of the other is a big warning sign (e.g., animal metaphors)
* leveraging by small interest groups that can swing power ⇒ increase polarization
* authoritarianism does the same

Centeno and liberalism:
* The turn-of-the-century consensus about market-driven liberalism is breaking down
* Boleslaw: polarization can lead to chaos
* Centeno: Polarization can be driven by the absence of an enemy; people who didn't participate in the revolution can "win".

DiMaggio:
* Reminds me a bit of Annie Lenox
* Polarization as both a state and a process
	* Division into opposites, bimodality
	* variance; if the groups are farther apart are they more polarized?
* Does it count
	* Salience
	* Constraint (are views highly correlated?)
* Looked at this way there hasn't been much polarization in the US
	* not more bimodal, variable, salient or constrained!
* Partisan polarization is increasing, though:
	* Issue alignment
	* Partisan sorting
* Affective polarization
	* Partisans don't agree less, they hate each other more
	* Yif: less punishment for extremists (from general electorate?)
	* Centeno: There is an empirical question of to what extent the party drives the voters vs. the other way around
* Leonard: objective vs. subjective polarization
* Michael: what drives polarization? McGovern wanted to democratize things by making primaries more important
* Affective polarization
	* People sort maritally by partisanship now, but not in the 70s
	* partisanship is much more of an identity thing now than before
	* real danger of lock-in
* Markus: the losers always want to "compromise"

Dushoff: within- vs. between- polarization

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Origins, dynamics and gerrymandering

Wang
* 1994 "pulse" in polarization
* Three criteria for something
	* Something, something and spatial something
* What variables move gradually and which change sharply?
* Escalation, the role of norms
	* What are the incentives?
	* In gerrymandering, it's places that are close to balance that have more incentive to escalate
* Causes and effects?
	* narrowcasting and distrust of elites
	* narrowcasting and something else
* Feldman: neutral gerrymandering (protect all incumbents)

Plotkin
* Strategic vs. real extremism

Conversation
* Charles: does polarization increase modularity leading to stability?
	* Simon: critical transitions are associated with reduced dimensionality
		* thus, polarization is more likely to reduce stability
	* Wang: as the parties become more separated (more correlation) there is more incentive for escalation
* Dushoff
	* Information asymmetries
	* Types of gerrymandering (racial ⇒ status quo ⇒ partisan?)
	* Within- vs. between- dynamics
* Marcus
	* Party structure in the US vs. everywhere
		* ties to earlier point about primaries
		* soft-money groups (less hierarchy)
	* Q: Does the weak control structure encourage polarization?
* Manfred
	* If polarization breaks hegemony, that could be a window for innovation
* Rodney
	* Racial vs partisan gerrymandering; more seats for minorities could benefit Republicans (unholy alliance)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Boleslaw: Polarization and political systems

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685022/

Data about increasing polarization; how is it scaled for them to decide that Republicans have moved more than Democrats?

Dynamical model of "social competition".

There's a hysteresis effect in polarization

Kinzig: what are the possible causes of polarization (global, regional and national)?

Levin: What is populism?
* Centeno: not that close to polarization
* Levin: Yuh-huh
* Centeno: anti-technocratic, anti-elite

Perrings:
* Global integration (different measures), starting from GATT
	* a process dominated by the US until ~2000
	* unravelled since then by regional agreements
	* return of tariffs
* What is polarization at the international scale?
	* Unravelling of pseudo-nations (Yugoslavia, Europe)

Michael: 
* 2008 recession, opioid crisis ignored at the highest levels
* Opportunities for Bannon, Trump, Johnson
* Negative aspects of global trade agreements
	* Larry Summers recent statement

Manfred:
* Europe 50s to 80s, general agreement between capital and labor
	* some sort of transition where labor is supposed to have become more nationalistic
	* Green party has a broader international view; coming together with capital and growing

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Marcus and Keena: Big data? Individuals? Media impact, apparently

## Keena

Media environment:
* Social, traditional, direct mail, personal conversations, ads

hypodermic effect:
* you encounter a piece of information and you take it in

What are the actual obstacles?
* reception: do you just change the channel?
* acceptance: do you engage
	* motivated reasoning
* retention: education, knowledge
	* affect may remain after information is gone

polarization-related traits (focus on affective polarization)
* partisanship and the reaction to misinformation (FAKE NEWS!)
* moderates and the tendency to drop out of the electorate

## Marcus

See my piece

The value of repetition
* Is it a significant cause of polarization
* Messages coming from polarized sources

Who is exposed to which messages?
* Hard to analyze

## Questions

Plotkin: how ocan you tell that people are dropping out?
* Marcus: ask people their preference for news vs. entertainment; people who like news better are more likely to vote

Miguel: How much comparison is there to the Reformation (driven by the printing press)? Has anyone worked on depolarization by media?
* Yif: there is good empirical research showing that Fox news increased polarization; good studies of how Fox news rolled out ("basically" at random) -- also channel numbers (much bigger effect than MS-NBC)
* Yif: other things are harder to disentangle; FB and twitter are conflated. One study of people who were paid to drop FB for a month
* Yif: results about exposure to the other side are mixed

Michael: why is talk radio so right wing?
* Wang. What's the cause and effect? 
* Note-taker: Fairness doctrine change in 1987

Paul:
* Heterogeneity of media effects (mostly inaudible)
* individual characteristics and networks

Feldman:
* Newspaper depolarization in the early 1900s.
	* Newspaper concentration gives an incentive
* FCC rules about urban concentration and radio
	* Does this relate to the right-wing talk radio? 

Naomi: Inoculation theory
* Vaccination against misinformation
* JD: Finland https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/05/europe/finland-fake-news-intl/

Chai: What is known about how context affects processing
* when you're driving, on your phone …

Andrea: ad revenue as part of a polarizing feedback loop?
* Keena: not convinced, but not clear why
* Andrea: I see different ads during editorial times vs. news times
* Yif: there is some evidence (from the past?) about advertising leading to centrism
	* Sleeping giants runs campaigns to target egregious people like Tucker Carlson

Plotkin: does Fox news polarize people?
* Yes. Why is Marcus downplaying it?
* Because other people overplay it

A lot of things remind me of the Facebook Ethics xkcd: https://xkcd.com/1390/

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Manfred: Evolutionary, psychological and cultural dimensions

Can we identify principles that would explain the rise of polarization
* from an evolutionary pov?

Evolution is a form of signal detection

What are the signalling issues behind political polarization?

Prum: positive feedback between the signal and the reception
* peacocks and runaway selection
* relates to identity vectors; stronger signal is less ambiguous
* notetaker: relates to cultural runaways: burqas, kashrut, non-dancing Baptists

Kinzig: yes, it could be a universal mechanism but why now?

Manfred: well, it happens a lot, but it seems to still be interesting why now

Evolution: Simple models with variation and fitness functions are a nice starting point. Only.
* Need to consider the mechanisms that construct the selective niche

Social-media echo chambers are an example of a niche
* the way to get attention there is to become more extreme

What is an extreme signalling event?
* Anti-semitic, racist, nationalist
* What about the left? Pronoun-listing
	* Nobody here does that!

Variation:
* How much variation is tolerated by a regulatory system?
* What are the dynamics of the system itself?

Charles: What are signals of polarization and its outcomes
* Manfred: Need more information
* Simon: CS literature has a lot of study of early warnings

Jonathan:
* We should pick up Simon's idea about extremism on one side driving extremism on the other (e.g., pronouns)
* Wild analogy with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting

Marcus: How does the analogy work? People are agents making choices on a very different scale than evolving peacocks
